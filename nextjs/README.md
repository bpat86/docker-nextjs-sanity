# This is where your Next.js app goes

To get started, delete this file and spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md).

Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `nextjs` directory.

To install a brand new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm nextjs_npx create-next-app . --use-npm
```
