## This is where your Next.js app goes

To get started, delete this file and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `nextjs` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new Next.js project by running `npx create-next-app .` in your terminal.
